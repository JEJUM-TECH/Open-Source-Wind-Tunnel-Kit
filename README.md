## 📖 Introduction (소개)
The **Open-Source Modular Wind Tunnel Kit** is designed to solve the problem of expensive educational equipment. By utilizing FDM 3D printing, we **drastically reduced the manufacturing cost** compared to commercial kits while maintaining engineering reliability.

This project is perfect for:
* **STEM Education:** Teaching lift, drag, and fluid dynamics in schools.
* **Makers & Hobbyists:** Testing RC planes, drones, or 3D printed models.
* **Research:** Visualizing streamlines with smoke and measuring lift coefficients.

## ✨ Key Features (핵심 특징)
* **🏭 Fully 3D Printable:** All structural parts are designed to be printed on standard FDM printers (PLA/PETG).
* **🧩 Modular Design:** Easy to assemble/disassemble using pins (`OnePin.ipt`) without glue.
* **💨 Flow Quality Control:** Includes **Honeycomb** and **Screen** structures to ensure uniform laminar flow.
* **📊 Smart Measurement:** Compatible with **Beam Load Cell** & **Arduino** systems to measure Lift force.
* **✅ Verified Performance:** Validated against NACA 0012 experimental data (Re ≈ 48k).
